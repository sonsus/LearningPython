##Use of __init__.py

The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later (deeper) on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.

#Django Start!   
####Django repository would be useful after mastering git push on pc

```bash
> conda install django 

(works for both python 3.5 and 3.6 but consider using 3.5 for variousity and stability of distributed modules)

> django-admin mysite

(make django project directory at current directory)

> cd path/to/mysite
> pwd
		path/to/mysite
> ls
		path/ manange.py
> python manage.py runserver
