#Nested function

1.Inner functions can access variables from the enclosing scope (in this case, the local variable x). If you're not accessing any variables from the enclosing scope, they're really just ordinary functions with a different scope.  
2.Readability

```python
def make_adder(x):
    def add(y):
        return x + y
    return add

plus5 = make_adder(5)
print(plus5(12))

#inspect module
inspect module cannot be used for peeking the source codes of built-in functions  
it provides methods to inspect where the methods, functions, or classes came from 

inspect.getdoc(object)
inspect.getcomments(object)
inspect.getfile(object)
inspect.getmodule(object)
inspect.getsourcefile(object): 
inspect.getsourcelines(object) ---????
Return a list of source lines and starting line number for an object. The argument may be a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object. The source code is returned as a list of the lines corresponding to the object and the line number indicates where in the original source file the first line of code was found. An OSError is raised if the source code cannot be retrieved.

Changed in version 3.3: OSError is raised instead of IOError, now an alias of the former.

inspect.getsource(object)
Return the text of the source code for an object. The argument may be a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object. The source code is returned as a single string. An OSError is raised if the source code cannot be retrieved.

Changed in version 3.3: OSError is raised instead of IOError, now an alias of the former.

inspect.cleandoc(doc)
Clean up indentation from docstrings that are indented to line up with blocks of code.

All leading whitespace is removed from the first line. Any leading whitespace that can be uniformly removed from the second line onwards is removed. Empty lines at the beginning and end are subsequently removed. Also, all tabs are expanded to spaces.

```python

>>> import inspect as i
>>> import numpy as np
>>> i.getdoc(sorted)

'Return a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.\n\nA custom key function can be supplied to customise the sort order, and the\nreverse flag can be set to request the result in descending order.'

>>> i.getsource(sorted)

TypeError: <built-in function sorted> is not a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object

>>> i.getsourcefile(np.ndarray)                 or               i.getfile(np.ndarray)
'C:\\Users\\xozmf\\Anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\numpy\\__init__.py'

>>> i.getsource(np)
